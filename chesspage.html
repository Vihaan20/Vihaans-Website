<h3>How pieces move</h3>

<h4>pawns</h4>

<p>pawns move the simplest in chess.<br>
     They move 2 squares on the second or 7th rank if its their first move. then after they pass their first move they can only move one square at a time <br>
    unlike other pieces pawns don't capture on the squarethey land on. They can only capture diagonally in front of them

<h4>bishops</h4>

<p>bishops are a bit more complicated than pawns.<br>
     they move in a diagonal form. They are allowed to do this any amount of squares</p>

<h4>rooks</h4>

<p>Rooks are very similar to bishops.<br>
     They don't move in a diagonal form though they move in a straight line. They can move in a straight line backwards, forwards, right and left</p>

<h4>Kings</h4>

<h4>Queens</h4>

<p>Queens are the most powerful piece in the game <br>
    The reason for this is that they are allowed to move in any direction any amount of squares, easily making it the most powerful attacking and defending piece
</p>

<h4>Knights</h4>

<img src="Knightimage.png" alt="The Chess Knight" id="chess images">

<p>Knights are the most complex moving piece in the game. <br>
    There are two ways to visualize knights. <br>
    the first way which is how I learnt is that they move one diagonal and one forward any direction <br>
    The second and possibly more popular way is to visualize it like an L in any direction with the length being two squares and the width being 1 square. <br>
    This piece is the only piece able to jump over other pieces in its way to its landing square.
